# Enriching SharePoint Image Libraries with Azure Cognitive Services

Azure Logic App demonstrating how you can enrich image data in SharePoint using Azure Cognitive Services.

You will need access to the following in order to use this code:

- A SharePoint Online (or SharePoint on-premises) Document Library to which you can authenticate a [Logic App SharePoint Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-sharepoint).
- An Azure Subscription (Trial or Paid) - sign-up for your free trial at [http://azure.com/free](http://azure.com/free). This demo will run happily within a Trial account.
- Images against which you can train a Custom Vision classifier. The [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) is a good starting point.
